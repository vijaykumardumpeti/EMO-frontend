# React Authentication Example

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of user authentication in a React application. It includes pages for login, registration, and logout.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-authentication-example.git
   cd react-authentication-example
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Login Page
Visit http://localhost:3000/login to access the login page. Enter your credentials and click the "Login" button.

Registration Page
Visit http://localhost:3000/register to access the registration page. Fill out the registration form and click the "Register" button.

Logout Page
Visit http://localhost:3000/logout to access the logout page. Click the "Logout" button to log out from the application.

Implementation Details
Login Page (src/pages/LoginPage.js): Allows users to log in with their username and password.

Registration Page (src/pages/RegistrationPage.js): Allows new users to register by providing a username and password.

Logout Page (src/pages/LogoutPage.js): Allows users to log out from the application.

Dependencies
React
React Router
Other dependencies as specified in package.json
Backend Integration
This project assumes the presence of a backend API for authentication. Ensure that your backend provides the necessary endpoints for login, registration, and logout.

Security Considerations
Passwords should be securely hashed on the server side.
Implement token-based authentication for a more secure user session management.
